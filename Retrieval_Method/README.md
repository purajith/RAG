Retrieval methods

 🔹 1. **Sparse Retrieval**
Relies on term matching (like keyword search).
- **BM25**: Traditional and widely used; uses TF-IDF and inverse document frequency.
- **TF-IDF**: Matches terms based on their relative importance in a document.
- ** partial matching**
  
 Good for exact keyword or term match.

---

🔹 2. **Dense Retrieval**
Uses vector representations (embeddings) for semantic search.
- **Dual Encoder Models** (e.g., DPR - Dense Passage Retrieval)
- **Sentence Transformers** (e.g., `all-MiniLM`, `multi-qa-mpnet-base`)
- **FAISS**, **Pinecone**, **Weaviate**, etc., used for indexing and similarity search.

 Better for understanding **contextual meaning** even without exact word match.

---

 🔹 3. **Hybrid Retrieval**
Combines both sparse and dense retrieval for better accuracy.
- Weighted or merged results from BM25 + Dense Embeddings.
- Tools: **Haystack**, **ColBERT**, **LlamaIndex hybrid retrieval**

 Balances precision and semantic understanding.

---

 🔹 4. **Multimodal Retrieval**
Retrieves from multiple types of data: text, image, audio, etc.
- Uses CLIP for text-image search
- Useful in **multimodal RAG** (e.g., combining documents and diagrams)

 Ideal when dealing with images, videos, PDFs with diagrams, etc.

---

 🔹 5. **Knowledge Graph-based Retrieval**
- Uses structured knowledge bases or graphs (e.g., Neo4j)
- Nodes and edges capture relationships between entities

 Great for domain-specific logic and factual consistency.

---

 🔹 6. **Feedback-based Retrieval (Re-ranking)**
- After initial retrieval, results are re-ranked based on relevance using models like BERT or cross-encoders.

 Improves precision in critical tasks (e.g., legal or medical search).

Great question!

Both **BM25** and **Fuzzy Search** support **partial matching**, but they are designed for **different types of partiality**. Here's a clear comparison to help you choose the best one for your use case:

---

### 🔍 1. **BM25** – *Semantic or Token-Level Partial Match*

- **Use Case**: Matching documents that **contain some query terms**, not necessarily all.
- **Best for**:
  - Keyword-based search
  - Information retrieval
  - RAG systems
- **Example**:  
  Query: `"deep learning health"`  
  Matches: `"deep learning in healthcare"`, even if "health" ≠ "healthcare".

> ✅ BM25 is great for finding **relevant documents even when only some terms match**.

---

### 🔍 2. **Fuzzy Search** – *Character-Level Typo/Spell Match*

- **Use Case**: Handling **typos or minor spelling errors** in terms.
- **Best for**:
  - Searching misspelled names, usernames, etc.
  - Typo tolerance
- **Example**:  
  Query: `"heath"`  
  Matches: `"health"` because it's only 1 character different.

> ✅ Fuzzy search is great when users **mistype words or names**.

### ✅ Summary: Which One to Choose?

| Feature                    | BM25                        | Fuzzy Search               |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------|
| Partial term match        | ✔ Yes                       | ✖ No (character level only)|
| Typo handling             | ✖ No                        | ✔ Yes                      |
| Meaning/context based     | ✔ Yes (sort of)             | ✖ No                       |
| Works well for RAG        | ✔ Perfect fit               | ✖ Not ideal                |

---

### ✅ Your Case (RAG or AI Search):
**Use BM25** if you care about **relevance and partial keyword matching**.

**Use Fuzzy Search** only if you're trying to correct user **typos** or **misspellings**.
